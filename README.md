# Underwater Basket Weaving on Oculus
An underwater basket weaving game for the Oculus Quest.

## Description
Underwater Basket Weaving for Oculus is a fun spin on the classic activity / college course of perfecting the art of basket weaving underwater. You will be able to change and customize your character and purchase different materials with the baskets you sell to make more intricate and grandiose baskets.

## Scope
We are looking to provide many updates after the games release to squash all bugs and to respond to player response. As of now, there will be the main campaign, with multiplayer scheduled for a late 2023 release.

## MODULE
Adding materials to inventory for basket weaving (pine, straw, willow, oak, wisteria, forsythia, vines, stems, animal hair, hide, grasses, thread, and fine wooden splints.)
